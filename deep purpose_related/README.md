Methodology#4 - Drug repurposing using drug protein interaction and Binding Affinity using deeppurpose Toolkit <br>

Follow the installation instruction of DeepPurpose tool kit from https://github.com/kexinhuang12345/DeepPurpose <br>
After the installation of the tool kit, navigate to the base directory called DeepPurpose from the installed location <br>
Create a new directory called all_protein_seq under the data directory <br>
Create a new directory called virtual_screening_results under the home/working directory <br>
Create a new directory called repurposing_results under the home/working directory <br>
Copy the content of all protein sequence files into data/all_protein_seq under home/working directory <br>
Copy viral_drugs.csv file into data directory under home/working directory <br>
Copy the dataset.py file into deeppurpose/dataset directory <br>
Copy the models.py file into deeppurpose/dataset directory <br>
Copy the oneliner.py file into deeppurpose/dataset directory <br>
Copy the "Drug_repurposing_using_drug_protein_interaction_and_Binding Affinity_using_deeppurpose_methodology4-v1.ipynb" ipython (ipynb) notebook into your 
home/working directory <br>
Ensure that all above files and the ipython notebook (ipynb) are in the correct directory <br>
Execute ipython notebook scripts by sequence order <br>
