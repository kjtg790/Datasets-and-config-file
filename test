Methodology#4 Drug repurposing using drug protein interaction and Binding Affinity using deeppurpose Toolkit <br>
Drug Target Interaction will take more than 60 mins <br>
Drugs re-purposing methods during early stages of pandemic using COVID-19 as example Important Instructions Setup DeepPurpose Tool Kit, Working directory, copy files, execute scripts <br>

Follow the installation instruction of DeepPurpose tool kit from https://github.com/kexinhuang12345/DeepPurpose  <br>
After the installation of the tool kit, navigate to the base directory called DeepPurpose from the installed location  <br>
Create a new directory called all_protein_seq under the data directory  <br>
Create a new directory called virtual_screening_results under the home/working directory  <br>
Create a new directory called repurposing_results under the home/working directory  <br>
Copy the content of all protein sequence files into data/all_protein_seq under home/working directory  <br>
Copy viral_drugs.csv file into data directory under home/working directory  <br>
Copy the dataset.py file into deeppurpose/dataset directory  <br>
Copy the models.py file into deeppurpose/dataset directory  <br>
Copy the oneliner.py file into deeppurpose/dataset directory  <br>
Copy the ipython (ipynb) notebook "Drug_repurposing_using_drug_protein_interaction_and_Binding Affinity_using_deeppurpose_methodology4-v1.ipynb" into your home/working directory  <br>
Ensure that all above files and the ipython notebook (ipynb) are in the home/working directory  <br>
Execute ipython notebook scripts by sequence order  <br>
